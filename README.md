# Study-Buddy-the-open-source-digital-assignment-planner-and-digital-pet-device
Welcome to Study Buddy! This project is an open-source combination of a digital assignment planner and a digital pet device designed to make productivity fun and engaging.

Simply follow the schematic and flash the provided code to use the Study Buddy

Notice:
This project is a work in progress, as of right now it is functional but there are some aspects of it missing, these are:

-Some Empty pet frames (for more details see (Frames Guide))
-Unfinished case .stl file (not necessary for function)

-Limited functionality; if this project gains enough support or turns out to actually be desired by people, then there are also a lot of features I want to bring to it in the future such as:
-Different types of pets
-Pet names 
-More pet emotions and statistics 
-A pet house
-Pet minigames
-Making a PCB for this project
