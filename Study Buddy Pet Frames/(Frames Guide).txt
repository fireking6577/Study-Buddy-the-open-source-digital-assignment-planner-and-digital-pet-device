The SD card does NOT read from this folder, these images are only examples. The original sprites are represented in the esp32 script as byte arrays. 
if you would like to alter or change the sprites displayed on the screen, please edit the program and change the byte arrays (present at the start of the program)
you can convert 128x64 images into byte arrays using this link: https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/
