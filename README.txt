Notice:
This project is a work in progress, as of right now it is functional but there are some aspects of it missing, these are:

-Some Empty pet frames (for more details see (Frames Guide))
-Unfinished case .stl file (not necessary for function)

-Limited functionality; if this project gains enough support or turns out to actually be desired by people, then there are also a lot of features I want to bring to it in the future such as:
-Different types of pets
-Pet names 
-More pet emotions and statistics 
-A pet house
-Pet minigames
-Making a PCB for this project
